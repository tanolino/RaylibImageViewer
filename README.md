# RaylibImageViewer
Example project to see how Raylib works as base for an image viewer.

## Why ?
I was looking for a neat image viewer and thought "100mb is much just to look at images" or "This can't be so hard". Yep, and here we are.

## How to build
Check out this repo, initialize submodules, have CMake and a C compiler installed.

You can use CMake directly or implicit via build script via `build.bat pc` or `./build.sh pc`.

This project was building with:
* GCC and MSVC 2022 on Win10
* GCC and Clang on Ubuntu
